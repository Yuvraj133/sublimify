# Sublimify
##### Sublime Text like UI theme for Atom.

---

This is a fork of the [atom-dark-ui] theme.

This theme changes the color scheme of the ```tree-view``` to match that of Sublime Text.
Use this along with the [Monokai] syntax theme and you'll feel like you're back in Sublime Text.

[Monokai]: <https://atom.io/packages/monokai>
